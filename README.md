# wabde-widgets

This is a collection of widgets intended for use
with a [Docker project](https://github.com/Wildsong/docker-wabde)
that helps you to put together and maintain
a development environment for the
"Esri Web AppBuilder, Developer Edition" aka "WABDE".

Each standard Esri widget that comes packaged with WABDE
is licensed under Apache 2.0.

I have put each widget into a github project and include it here as a submodule.

So far they are all identical to the widgets from WABDE.

I will be adding more widgets from other sources tomorrow.

## Other Esri files

I have not figured out how to get these files into the right place yet, so I stuck them
in this repo. They belong in this level in clients/stemapp/widgets in WABDE. Putting them
here means you just do a clone into widgets and everything is good to go.

In fact I have not figured out what they do yet either. I assume that the WAB uses them
when building applications over in server/apps to include the widgets?? Whatever. For now
I just assume they have to be here.

They are all covered under Apache 2.0 and copyright ESRI.

main.js
package.js
package.json
widgets.d.ts

You probably don't need anything in here.

When I did the initial import of the Esri widgets
I hacked together some scripts to do the repetitive work.
They are not ready for release so I tucked them away here.

I will probably need them again when a new Esri release comes out to update everything.

The paths are all wrong since they used to be up on level.

Also I comment and uncomment sections as needed... caveat emptor for now anyway.
